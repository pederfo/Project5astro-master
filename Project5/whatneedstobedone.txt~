Set number of objects
Set final time of simulation
set time step
Set size of sphere we want objects inside
Initialize positions of objects inside sphere
Initialize velocities of objects

start time loop
	update positions and velocities with method
	print positions (and velocities?) to file
end time loop

use python file to make 3D video of simulation


TWO BODY PROBLEM
1. Use Rk4 and Velocity-Verlet on 2 body problem. use whatever masses and dimensions you want.
2. Compare stability of methods.
3. How do they work for very long times?
4. Compare time used to advance one time step.
5. Comment results
6. Decide which methods you would use for systems requiring long times.

OPEN CLUSTER
1. Extend code to arbitrary number of objects, N
2. Start with unifrom distribution inside sphere R_0
3. Start all at rest (v=0)
4. Use masses with gaussian distribution around ten solar masses with standard deviation of 1 solar mass.
5. use solar masses and light years as units for mass in length, and make equations dimensionless
